  **Credits**
  
  I've developed almost all the features. The Hypixel API wrapper that I use for the Hypixel commands is so kindly provided by Snuggle (visit him [here](https://github.com/Snuggle)) and my exec command (which isn't fully working in this commit because I need to do some compatibility work) is made by the Espy, God himself (visit him and give him some love [here](https://github.com/neko404notfound/)).
  
  
  So this are the current feaures of CyborgToast! Feel free to make any suggestions by DMing me @Tmpod#0836.
  If you are the owner of a Discord Guild feel free to contact me so that I can costumize my bot to fit your server needs!
